#summary How to get StellaAI to run using RL-Glue v3 and an Atari agent that uses RL-Glue 3.

There are several steps you need to do to get StellaAI running using RL-Glue 3 with an RL-Glue 3 compatible agent. This document describes how to do so. 

  # Download the required packages. You'll need: 
    * RL-Glue 3. Get a stable package from [http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue/ RL-Glue project page]
    * RL-Glue extensions. Get a stable package from [http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue-ext/ RL-Glue extensions page]
    * StellaAI RL-Glue 3 branch source code. Detailed instructions below. 
    * An RL-Glue 3 compatible random agent, [http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lanctot/files/atari_random_rlglue3.tar.gz atari_random_rlglue3.tar.gz] 
  # Install RL-Glue 3.
If you downloaded RC2 and want to install it as root: 
{{{
tar -xzvf rlglue-3.0-RC2.tar.gz
cd rlglue-3.0-RC2
su - 
./configure
make
make check
make install
}}}
Or, as a regular user with prefix /home/username:
{{{
tar -xzvf rlglue-3.0-RC2.tar.gz
cd rlglue-3.0-RC2
./configure --prefix=/home/username
make
make check
make install
}}}
