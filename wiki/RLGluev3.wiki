#summary How to get StellaAI to run using RL-Glue v3 and an Atari agent that uses RL-Glue 3.

There are several steps you need to do to get StellaAI running using RL-Glue 3 with an RL-Glue 3 compatible agent. This document describes how to do so. 

=== 1. Download the required packages ===

You'll need: 
    * RL-Glue 3. Get a stable package from [http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue/ RL-Glue project page]
    * RL-Glue extensions (C codec). Get a stable package from [http://code.google.com/p/rl-glue-ext/ RL-Glue extensions page]
    * StellaAI RL-Glue 3 branch source code. Detailed instructions below. 
    * An RL-Glue 3 compatible random agent, [http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lanctot/files/atari_random_rlglue3.tar.gz atari_random_rlglue3.tar.gz] 

=== 2. Install RL-Glue 3. ===

If you downloaded RC2 and want to install it as root: 
{{{
tar -xzvf rlglue-3.0-RC2.tar.gz
cd rlglue-3.0-RC2
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
}}}

Or, as a regular user with prefix /home/username:
{{{
tar -xzvf rlglue-3.0-RC2.tar.gz
cd rlglue-3.0-RC2
./configure --prefix=/home/username
make
make check
make install
}}}

=== 3. Install RL-Glue C codec. ===

If you downloaded version 2.0 of the codec and want to install it as root:
{{{
tar -xzvf c-codec-2.0-RC2.tar.gz
cd c-codec-2.0
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}

Or, as a regular user with prefix /home/username:
{{{
tar -xzvf c-codec-2.0-RC2.tar.gz
cd c-codec-2.0
./configure --prefix=/home/username --with-rl-glue=/home/username
make
make install
}}}

=== 4. Get RL-Glue 3 enabled StellaAI ===

At the moment this is in a branch. Maybe later when RL-Glue 3 is officially release it will be merged into the trunk.
