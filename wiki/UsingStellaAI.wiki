  * {{{PROTOCOL_NONE}}} - No protocol is used (standalone emulator)
  * {{{PROTOCOL_PLAINTEXT}}} - Plain text protocol
  * {{{PROTOCOL_RLGLUE}}} - RL-Glue protocol

=== Linux ===

Simple type {{{make}}} from the root directory to create the executable.

Begin the PTP Agent and then call StellaAI as if it was running by itself.

Start RL-Glue, agent and experiment then call StellaAI the same way as above.
